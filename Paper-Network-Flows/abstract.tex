As mobile technologies become part of modern society, Android's dominance in the global smartphone market has made it a prime target for cyberattacks. The Android platform faces a growing threat from malware, particularly repackaged apps that embed malicious code to exploit user data. While sandbox-based approaches, such as Mining Android Sandbox (MAS), have been effective in detecting repackaged malware by analyzing sensitive API interactions, they often fall short in identifying more complex threats. This paper introduces a complementary approach that integrates network flow analysis with \mas to improve malware detection. By analyzing the network traffic generated by Android applications, alongside behavioral data from \mas, this method uncovers malicious activities that may remain hidden within the appâ€™s behavior. Using machine learning on network traffic data collected via TcpDump, combined with \mas insights, our method improves the accuracy of malware detection. Results demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the identification of malware, offering a more comprehensive solution for securing Android applications against evolving threats.
