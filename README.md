This is the replication package for the paper: Using Network Flow Data and Machine Learning as Support for Mining Android Sandbox

### Abstract

As mobile technologies become part of modern society, Android’s dominance in the global smartphone market has made it
a prime target for cyberattacks. The Android platform faces a growing threat from malware, particularly repackaged apps that embed
malicious code to exploit user data. While sandbox-based approaches, such as Mining Android Sandbox (MAS), have been effective in
detecting repackaged malware by analyzing sensitive API interactions, they often fall short in identifying more complex threats. This
paper introduces a complementary approach that integrates network flow analysis with MAS approach to improve malware detection.
By analyzing the network traffic generated by Android applications, alongside behavioral data from MAS approach, this method
uncovers malicious activities that may remain hidden within the app’s behavior. Using machine learning on network traffic data
collected via TcpDump, combined with MAS approach insights, our method improves the accuracy of malware detection. Results
demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the identification of malware, offering a more comprehensive solution
for securing Android applications against evolving threats.
